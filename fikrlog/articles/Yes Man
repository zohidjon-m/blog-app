am a "yes man" by nature. I see a good opportunity - I say yes.

Until recently, I didn't realize that all the "yes" I have said is actually "no" to a hundred better things I could do instead. 
In this article, I'd like to share my thoughts and experience about knowing when to say "No".

In the book “It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work“ by Jason Fried, there's a really good comparison between yes and no:

No is easier to do, yes is easier to say
No is no to one thing. Yes is no to a thousand things
No is a precision instrument, a surgeon’s scalpel, a laser beam focused on one point
Yes is a blunt object, a club, a fisherman’s net that catches everything indiscriminately
No is specific
Yes is general
No is calm but hard. Yes is easy but a flurry. Knowing what you’ll say no to is better than knowing what you’ll say yes to. Know no.
Saying "no" is hard, but trust me saying "yes" then "no" is a lot harder. So before you say "yes" to anything, think ahead and make decisions wisely.

We all have limited time and resources. Doing the right thing at the right time is the key to success. Focus means you have to say no to all other things. No matter how better or easier they are.
